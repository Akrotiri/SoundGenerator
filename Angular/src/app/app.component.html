      The Sound Generator composes music and saves it into an audio file. The application is written in C# and it is not using any additional libraries, than the standard libraries of the .Net framework. The sound waves are calculated using the math function Math.sin. For a better result, many sinus waves are merged to create one single tone. The application works well in the mono project, so it can be run on a linux system as a console application, or it can be hosted as a webservice.

      For composing the app is using random values. To prevent the song from sounding like a weird futurisitc computer sound, I added a lot of rules. Those rules are based on music theory. Good results I got with a kind of blues scheme.

      Please feel free to try the app and listen to the funny result!
